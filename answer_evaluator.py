Answer Evaluation Module for ResearchPal AI

This module provides functionality to evaluate the quality of answers generated
by the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. It combines LLM-based
evaluation with semantic similarity checking to provide a comprehensive
assessment of answer quality.

Key Components:
1. AnswerEvaluation: A Pydantic model defining the structure of the evaluation results.
2. BaseEvaluator: An abstract base class for answer evaluators.
3. AnswerEvaluator: The main evaluator class that performs the actual evaluation.

The evaluation process considers several aspects of the answer:
- Relevance: How well the answer addresses the specific question asked.
- Completeness: Whether the answer covers all aspects of the query.
- Accuracy: The correctness of the information provided in the answer.
- Hallucination: Detection of information not supported by or contradicted by the given context.
- Coherence: The logical structure and flow of the answer.

Additionally, it uses semantic similarity checking to compare the query and answer,
providing an objective measure of relevance based on vector representations.

Usage:
    evaluator = AnswerEvaluator(llm, embeddings)
    evaluation = evaluator.evaluate(query, answer, context)

Note: This module includes a placeholder FactChecker class for future implementation
of fact-checking functionality.
